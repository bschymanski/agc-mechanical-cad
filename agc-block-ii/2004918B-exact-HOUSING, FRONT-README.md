## 20004918 rev. B - HOUSING, FRONT - AGC DSKY

general notes; if this model is application specific variant of an exact model (e.g., optimized for 3D printing), document the intended use and changes that were applied

## Source Drawing(s)

links to source drawings at the ibilio site

### Source Drawing Issues

None.

### Next Assembly
2003903

## Known Issues
### Model Discrepancies

1. In several places, the source drawing calls for holes to be drilled for threaded inserts rather that the actual threading.  In such places, the required final threading had been modeled instead.
2. The two Pin Dowels are not modeled, nor their insert holes

### To Do List

* Many holes still remain to be modeled
