# Virtual AGC Project: Mechanical CAD Models and Drawings

This repository contains downloadable Autodesk Fusion 360 and STEP CAD models of many Apollo Guidance Computer components.

The [Virtual AGC Project](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/) was originally almost exclusively focused on software simulation 
of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), the computer resident in both the Apollo Command Module and Lunar Excusion Module. Over time,
the Virtual AGC Project moved in many related directions. Recently Rob Burkey, the project's creator, located, scanned, and published
the [original MIT/NASA electrical and mechanical drawings of the AGC](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html).

The models in this repository represent my work using Fusion 360 to generate models of these original parts using a modern CAD/CAM system.
