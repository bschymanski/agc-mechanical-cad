# AGC Mechanical CAD Models and Drawings

This repository contains downloadable Autodesk Fusion 360 and STEP CAD models of many Apollo Guidance Computer components.

## Introduction

The [Virtual AGC Project](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/) was originally focused on software simulation 
of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). The AGC was the computer installed in both the Apollo Command Module and Lunar Excursion Module.

Over time, the Virtual AGC Project branched in many directions. Simulation projects for other space related guidance systems
were researched; hybrid hardware and software models of the AGC were created. The circuitry of the AGC has been reproduced using modern IC components. 

Recently Ron Burkey, the Virtual AGC project's creator, scanned, cataloged, and published
the [original MIT electrical and mechanical drawings of the AGC](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html).

The content in this repository represents my work using Fusion 360 to generate CAD models from those original drawings using modern CAD/CAM tooling.

## How These Models Were Created

[Autodesk's Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) was used exclusively to create these models. 
While Fusion 360 is not open source software, Autodesk offers a no-cost
license to students, makers, and startups. You can obtain your own copy of Fusion 360 and begin editing the .f3d files contained in this project. 
STEP-format CAD models for each component have been exported and included in this project as well. 
Those model files are directly usable by many other CAD modeling and 3D-printing systems.

Panel markings use an engraving font face called "Gorton". Eugene Dorr created OTF and TTF versions of these fonts. These files can be downloaded from https://github.com/ehdorrii/dsky-fonts 

## Is This a Complete AGC Model?

No. I am releasing what I have transcribed so far. That amounts to roughly a half-dozen models. Each is currently 90-100% completely encoded from the original engineering documents.

I'm working to maintain engineering precision wherever I can. Errors undoubtedly exist, and I'm my own Quality
Assurance department currently. In other words, use at your own risk.

## My Background

My name is Riley Rainey. I'm a software developer by profession. I spent a number of years building aerospace simulations as my day job.
I'm not a Professional Engineer by any stretch, but my work in simulation put me in close contact with CAD designers and CAD systems. I used AutoCad many years ago, but my exposure to Fusion 360 began with this project.

## Getting Support

There's no official support available, but if you notice a problem or have a request for a specific drawing to be
transcribed, [create an issue](https://github.com/rrainey/agc-mechanical-cad/issues) in this GitHub project.
