# Virtual AGC Project: Mechanical CAD Models and Drawings

This repository contains downloadable Autodesk Fusion 360 and STEP CAD models of many Apollo Guidance Computer components.

## Introduction

The [Virtual AGC Project](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/) was originally almost exclusively focused on software simulation 
of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). The AGC was the computer resident in both the Apollo Command Module and Lunar Excusion Module. 
It literally navigated man to the Moon and back.

Over time, the Virtual AGC Project moved in many related directions. Simulation projects for other space related guidance systems
are being worked on; hybrid hardware and software models of the AGC have been created. The circuitry of the AGC has been reproduced
using modern IC compoments.

Recently Ron Burkey, the Virtual AGC project's creator, located, scanned, and published
the [original MIT/NASA electrical and mechanical drawings of the AGC](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html).

The models in this repository represent my work using Fusion 360 to generate models from those original drawings using modern CAD/CAM tooling.

## How These Models Were Created

[Autodesk's Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) was used exclusively to create these models. 
While Fusion 360 is not open source software, Autodesk offers a no-cost
license to students, makers, and startups. You can obtain your own copy of Fusion 360 and begin editing the .f3d files contained in this project. 
STEP-format CAD models for each component have been exported and included in this project as well. 
Those model files are directly usable by many other CAD modeling and 3D-printing systems.
